# fibonacci_sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The beginning of the sequence is thus:

_0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ..._
